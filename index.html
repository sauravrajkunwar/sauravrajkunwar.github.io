            <h1>Nice to Meet You</h1>

            <p>
                I'm Saurav Raj Kunwar, a PhD candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the
                University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on the economics of
                agriculture, climate change, and environmental sustainability.
            </p>

            <p>
                I began my academic journey with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture from Tribhuvan
                University, followed by a Master of Science in Agricultural and Applied Economics from
                the University of Georgia. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Illinois
                Urbana Champaign.
            </p>

            <p>
                I study the value of environmental services from agricultural production, focusing on the
                balance between food security and environmental sustainability. My work quantifies the
                benefits of sustainable practices on soil health, carbon storage, and biodiversity, addressing
                the trade-offs between crop output and environmental outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using production economics, I estimate shadow prices for environmental services and
                evaluate economic incentives that support sustainable agricultural practices.
