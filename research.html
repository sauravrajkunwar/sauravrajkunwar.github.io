                <h3>Pricing Agricultural Environmental Services Under Policy-Consistent Normalizations</h3>

                <p>
                    Conservation programs differ in how they reward farmers: practice-based programs compensate
                    for adopting management practices, while outcome-based programs pay for measured environmental 
                    improvements. Yet the private costs of compliance under these alternative designs remain 
                    unclear. We develop a duality-based framework to value agricultural environmental services
                    under policy-consistent normalizations. A normalization selects a numeraire that reflects 
                    program objectives and determines how trade-offs among market and environmental outcomes are 
                    evaluated. Using Illinois corn production data, we demonstrate that practice-based normalizations 
                    result in lower shadow prices for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement, whereas 
                    outcome-based normalizations yield higher costs. Erosion control shows limited variation. By 
                    establishing shadow prices as policy-dependent measures, the framework provides a consistent 
                    economic basis for comparing conservation programs and setting incentive payments that align 
                    private management with environmental goals.

                <h3>What are the carbon services from cover-crop adoption worth from farmers' perspective?</h3>

                <p>
                    We derive shadow prices of carbon services provided by cover crops relative to non-cover-crop 
                    agricultural practices, accounting for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
                    We model the agricultural technology by integrating crop production, carbon sequestration, and 
                    GHG emissions. We derive a novel function representation of our technology using a data envelopment 
                    analysis (DEA). We then calculate shadow prices based on the dual representation of the technology 
                    and compare shadow prices between cover-crop and non-cover-crop fields. We find that the carbon 
                    sequestration and the GHG emissions reduction services from cover-crop fields relative to 
                    non-cover-crop fields are worth USD 17.88 and USD 9.42 per acre, respectively. We compare shadow 
                    prices to payments from an incentive program aimed at promoting cover-crop adoption, thereby 
                    highlighting the economic feasibility and potential barriers to adopting sustainable practices.

                <h3>Agricultural Productivity Index Decomposition with Weather and Adaptation Indicators</h3>

                <p>
                    Extreme weather events, including excessive heat, prolonged droughts, and intense precipitation, 
                    are becoming increasingly common due to climate change. As a result, farmers are encountering 
                    challenges in maintaining consistent crop yields and quality. These escalating events present 
                    significant challenges to agricultural crop production.
                <\p>
                
                <p> 
                    Given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and greater climatic variability, 
                    sustainable agricultural practices are gaining importance. Farmers are seeking strategies to 
                    mitigate risks and maintain productivity in response to these challenges. For example, cover 
                    cropping and conservation tillage operations are recognized as sustainable approaches that can 
                    help mitigate extreme weather impacts while reducing environmental harm and enhancing farm productivity.
                <\p>
                
                <p>
                    The study’s primary objective is to evaluate the role of adaptation measures used by farmers to mitigate 
                    the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production. Specifically, this study aims to determine 
                    whether adopting environmentally friendly management practices can enhance agricultural productivity and 
                    to provide valuable insights into sustainable practices in changing climate patterns, informing future 
                    agricultural strategies and policies.
