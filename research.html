        <h3>Pricing Agricultural Environmental Services Under Policy-Consistent Normalizations</h3>

        <p>
            Conservation programs differ in how they reward farmers: practice-based programs compensate 
            for adopting management practices, while outcome-based programs pay for measured environmental 
            improvements. Yet the private costs of compliance under these alternative designs remain unclear.
        </p>

        <p>
            We develop a duality-based framework to value agricultural environmental services under 
            policy-consistent normalizations. A normalization selects a numeraire that reflects program 
            objectives and determines how trade-offs among market and environmental outcomes are evaluated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using Illinois corn production data, we show that practice-based normalizations result in lower 
            shadow prices for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement, while outcome-based 
            normalizations produce higher costs. Erosion control shows limited variation.
        </p>

        <p>
            By establishing shadow prices as policy-dependent measures, the framework provides a consistent 
            basis for comparing conservation programs and setting incentive payments that align private 
            management with environmental goals.

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <h3>What are the carbon services from cover-crop adoption worth from farmers' perspective?</h3>

        <p>
            We derive shadow prices of carbon services provided by cover crops relative to non-cover-crop 
            agricultural practices, accounting for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We model agricultural technology by integrating crop production, carbon sequestration, and 
            GHG emissions. Using a data envelopment analysis (DEA), we derive a novel functional representation 
            of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            We then calculate shadow prices through the dual representation of the technology and compare 
            shadow prices between cover-crop and non-cover-crop fields. We estimate that carbon sequestration 
            and GHG emission reduction services from cover-crop fields are valued at USD 17.88 and USD 9.42 
            per acre, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            We compare these values to payments from incentive programs promoting cover-crop adoption, 
            highlighting economic feasibility and barriers to sustainable practice adoption.

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <h3>Agricultural Productivity Index Decomposition with Weather and Adaptation Indicators</h3>

        <p>
            Extreme weather events such as excessive heat, droughts, and intense rainfall are becoming more 
            frequent. These conditions create risks for consistent crop yields and quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sustainable agricultural practices are gaining importance as farmers adapt to climatic variability. 
            Cover cropping and conservation tillage are widely recognized approaches that can help mitigate the 
            impacts of extreme weather.
        </p>

        <p>
            This study evaluates the role of adaptation measures in agricultural production. We investigate 
            whether environmentally friendly management practices improve agricultural productivity and how 
            these practices contribute to climate resilience.
