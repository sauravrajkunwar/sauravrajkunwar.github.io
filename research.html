                <h3>Pricing Agricultural Environmental Services Under Policy-Consistent Normalizations</h3>

                <p>
                    Conservation programs differ in how they reward farmers: practice-based programs compensate 
                    for adopting management practices, while outcome-based programs pay for measured 
                    environmental improvements. We develop a duality-based framework to value agricultural 
                    environmental services under policy-consistent normalizations. Using Illinois corn 
                    production data, we show that practice-based normalizations result in lower shadow prices 
                    for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement, while outcome-based normalizations 
                    produce higher costs. The framework provides a policy-consistent basis for comparing 
                    conservation programs and setting incentive payments that align private behavior with 
                    environmental goals.

                <h3>What are the carbon services from cover-crop adoption worth from farmers' perspective?</h3>

                <p>
                    We derive shadow prices of carbon services provided by cover crops relative to 
                    non-cover-crop practices, using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) representation of 
                    production, carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions. Cover-crop fields 
                    generate carbon sequestration and GHG emission reduction services valued at USD 17.88 
                    and USD 9.42 per acre, respectively. Comparing these values to existing incentive 
                    programs highlights the economic feasibility and the barriers to adopting sustainable 
                    practices.

                <h3>Agricultural Productivity Index Decomposition with Weather and Adaptation Indicators</h3>

                <p>
                    Extreme weather events—including heat, drought, and intense rainfall—pose growing risks 
                    to agricultural production. This project evaluates how adaptation measures such as cover 
                    cropping and conservation tillage help farmers maintain productivity under increasing 
                    climatic variability and contribute to long-run resilience in agricultural systems.
