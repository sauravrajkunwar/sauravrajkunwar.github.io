                    <h3>Pricing Agricultural Environmental Services Under Policy-Consistent Normalizations</h3>

                    <p>
                        Conservation programs differ in how they reward farmers: practice-based programs compensate
                        for adopting management practices, while outcome-based programs pay for measured environmental
                        improvements. Yet the private costs of compliance under these alternative designs remain unclear.
                        We develop a duality-based framework to value agricultural environmental services under
                        policy-consistent normalizations. The normalization defines how trade-offs among market and
                        environmental outcomes are evaluated.
                        Using Illinois corn production data, we show that practice-based normalizations result in
                        lower shadow prices for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas abatement, while outcome-based
                        normalizations yield higher values. Erosion control shows limited variation.
                        This framework provides a consistent basis for comparing conservation programs and designing
                        incentive payments aligned with environmental goals.

                    <h2>Project 1</h2>
                    <h3>Carbon Services from Cover-Crop Adoption</h3>

                    <p>
                        We derive shadow prices of carbon services provided by cover crops relative to non-cover-crop
                        practices, incorporating sequestration and greenhouse gas reductions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) representation, we compute shadow prices based on the
                        dual representation of agricultural technology and compare values across cover-crop and non-cover-crop fields.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We find that carbon sequestration and GHG emission reduction from cover-crop fields are worth
                        USD 17.88 and USD 9.42 per acre, respectively. We compare these values to payments from incentive
                        programs promoting sustainable adoption.

                    <h3>Agricultural Productivity Index Decomposition with Weather Indicators</h3>

                    <p>
                        Extreme weather events — including heat waves, droughts, and intense precipitation —
                        are becoming increasingly common due to climate change, posing challenges for maintaining
                        stable crop yields.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As climatic variability increases, sustainable management practices such as cover cropping
                        and conservation tillage gain importance as buffers against weather-related risks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project evaluates how adaptation measures can mitigate weather impacts on productivity,
                        and whether environmentally friendly practices enhance long-term agricultural resilience.
