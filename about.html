            <h2>My Journey from Nepal to the USA</h2>

            <p>
                Born and raised in Nepal and coming to the USA for higher education, I often get asked
                interesting questions about my experiences, challenges, and surprises. Here’s a look
                at that journey through the questions I hear most often.
            </p>

            <h3>The Decision to Move</h3>
            <p>
                Motivated by the promise of quality education, I began a journey to the USA, excited
                to explore a new part of the world. Leaving my parents behind was tough, but the thrill
                of a new beginning made the farewell easier.
            </p>

            <h3>Settling In</h3>
            <p>
                Landing in New York with family waiting for me made the transition smoother. Later,
                I moved to Georgia for my master's program, where the UGA Nepali community and my
                advisor’s support helped me settle quickly. Cultural shocks were real—the casual
                greetings and the limited vegetarian food—but I adapted fast.
            </p>

            <h3>First Impressions</h3>
            <p>
                My first impression of the USA was of a country that never sleeps. I imagined skyscrapers
                everywhere, only to learn that this was true mainly for major cities.
            </p>

            <h3>Funny Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                My wife (then girlfriend), Suzu, and I, during our master's program at the University of Georgia, went to the UGA health center using Google Maps 
                and the campus transit system. After an hour on the bus, we ended up across the street from where we started and finally found
                the health center.
            </p>

            <h3>Life in the USA</h3>
            <p>
                Over the years, the love and respect I've received have made my life here smooth and memorable.
                I adapted well, but I still miss the momo and mountains of Nepal. Sometimes I pretend clouds
                on the horizon are mountains just to bring a bit of home into my day.
            </p>

            <h3>Advice for Others</h3>
            <p>
                To anyone from Nepal considering a similar journey: show love and respect to the people around
                you. It comes back to you, and it makes the adventure worth it.
