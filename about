        <h2>My Journey from Nepal to the USA</h2>

        <p>
            Born and raised in Nepal and coming to the USA for higher education, I often get asked some 
            interesting questions about my experiences, challenges, and surprises. Here’s a small look 
            at that journey, framed as answers to the questions I hear most often.
        </p>

        <h3>The Decision to Move</h3>
        <p>
            Motivated by the promise of quality education, I began a journey to the USA, excited to 
            explore a new part of the world. Leaving my parents behind was tough, but the thrill of a 
            new beginning made the farewell easier.
        </p>

        <h3>Settling In</h3>
        <p>
            Landing in New York with family waiting for me made the transition smoother than expected. 
            Later, I moved to Georgia for my master's program, where the UGA Nepali community and my 
            advisor’s support helped me settle quickly. Cultural shocks were real—the casual greetings 
            and the lack of vegetarian food—but I adapted fast.
        </p>

        <h3>First Impressions</h3>
        <p>
            My first impression of the USA was of a country that never sleeps. I imagined skyscrapers 
            everywhere, only to learn that this was true mainly for major cities.
        </p>

        <h3>Funny Experiences</h3>
        <p>
            I once tried to go to the UGA health center using Google Maps and the campus transit system. 
            After an hour on the bus, I ended up right across the street from where I had started—and 
            only then found the health center.
        </p>

        <h3>Life in the USA</h3>
        <p>
            Over the years, the love and respect I’ve received have made my life here smooth and memorable. 
            I adapted well, but I still miss the momo and mountains of Nepal. Sometimes I pretend clouds 
            on the horizon are mountains just to bring a bit of home into my day.
        </p>

        <h3>Advice for Others</h3>
        <p>
            To anyone from Nepal thinking about a similar journey: Love and respect the people around you. 
            It returns to you, and it makes the adventure worth it.
